## üéØ Goals

- Provide quality notes for Politecnico di Torino courses
- Create a shared resource for the student community
- Standardize note formatting and structure
- Support both LaTeX and Typst for document composition

## ü§ù Contributing

We are always looking for new contributors!
See the **[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md)** file for more information.

## üìö Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- [**`notes/`**](notes/): class notes
- [**`guide/`**](guide/): a simple guide to get started with the project
- [**`lib/`**](lib/): templates
- [**`resources/`**](resources/): shared resources (images, diagrams, etc.)

## üöÄ Installation and compilation

### LaTeX

We encourage using the **[LaTeX Workshop](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop) VS Code extension**.
In order to use it you need a TeX installation (see https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop/wiki/Install).
They "*strongly recommend **TeX Live***".

You may also need **Inkscape**.

> [!TIP]
> If VS Code is not your code editor of choice, you can mimic the intended compilation by reproducing the `latexmk` tool in [`.vscode/settings.json`](.vscode/settings.json).

### Typst

Version 0.12.0 or higher, see https://typst.app/

Compile with
``` bash
typst compile typst/guide.typ
```

### Python

In case you want to create figures with Python, use Python 3.x with dependencies from [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt).

For example, to create a **virtual environment** on Windows, run the following from the project root:

``` powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
